# React Native

React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.

- Weâ€™re going to cover the core concepts behind React:

  - components
  - JSX
  - props
  - state

## Interactive examples

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

const YourApp = () => {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: "center", alignItems: "center" }}>
      <Text>
        Try editing me! ðŸŽ‰
      </Text>
    </View>
  );
}

export default YourApp;
```

## Core Components and Native Components

React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and the app platformâ€™s native capabilities. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platformâ€™s APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable code.
