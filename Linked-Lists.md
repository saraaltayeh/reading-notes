# Reading: Linked Lists

## Big O

is an Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency. this efficiency is evaluated based on 2 factors:

1. Running Time (time efficiency)
The amount of time a function needs to complete.

2. Memory Space (space efficiency)
The amount of memory resources a function uses to store data and instructions.

- In order to analyze these limiting factors, we should consider 4 Key Areas for analysis:

1. Input Size: We will use the letter n to refer to the Input Size value.
2. Units of Measurement
3. Orders of Growth
4. Best Case, Worst Case, and Average Case

## Linked Lists

Linked List - A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.

### There are two types of Linked List

Singly - Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.

Doubly - Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.

## Linear data structures

- linear data structures, which means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed. We can think of a linear data structure like a game of hopscotch: in order to get to the end of the list.

- non-linear data structures, items donâ€™t have to be arranged in order, which means that we could traverse the data structure non-sequentially.
